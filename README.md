# quarkus-kotlin-command-mode

Minimal example to show a Kotlin + Quarkus app with a CLI application. 

Note that this does still contain a RESTful API (GreetingResource) but when the code is invoked this
is superseded by the console app (HelloWorldMain).

To run try './gradlew quarkusDev', then to alter the number of arguments passed into the CLI app use
'e' to edit command line args.
